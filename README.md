# Pipes and Filters
# chain filter commands using the pipe operator
ls | sort -r

# pipe the output of manual page for ls to head to display the first 20 lines
man ls | head -20

Shell and Environment Variables
# list all shell variables
set

# define a shell variable called my_planet and assign value Earth to it
my_planet=Earth

# display shell variable
echo $my_planet

# list all environment variables
env

# environment vars: define/extend variable scope to child processes
export my_planet
export my_galaxy='Milky Way'

  
  
# Metacharacters
# comments
# The shell will not respond to this message

# command separator
echo 'here are some files and folders'; ls

# file name expansion wildcard
ls *.json

# single character wildcard
ls file_2021-06-??.json

  
  
# Quoting
# single quotes - interpret literally
echo 'My home directory can be accessed by entering: echo $HOME'

# double quotes - interpret literally, but evaluate metacharacters
echo "My home directory is $HOME"

# backslash - escape metacharacter interpretation
echo "This dollar sign should render: \$"


  
# I/O Redirection
# redirect output to file
echo 'Write this text to file x' > x

# append output to file
echo 'Add this line to file x' >> x

# redirect standard error to file
bad_command_1 2> error.log

# append standard error to file
bad_command_2 2>> error.log

# redirect file contents to standard input
$ tr “[a-z]” “[A-Z]” < a_text_file.txt

# the input redirection above is equivalent to
$cat a_text_file.txt | tr “[a-z]” “[A-Z]”

                                      
                                      
# Command Substitution
# capture output of a command and echo its value
THE_PRESENT=$(date)
echo "There is no time like $THE_PRESENT"

# Command line arguments
./My_Bash_Script.sh arg1 arg2 arg3


# Batch vs. concurrent modes
# run commands sequentially
start=$(date); ./MyBigScript.sh ; end=$(date)

# run commands in parallel
./ETL_chunk_one_on_these_nodes.sh & ./ETL_chunk_two_on_those_nodes.sh
